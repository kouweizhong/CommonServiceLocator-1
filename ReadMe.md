# Common Service Locator

Provides a common interface and service locator for leveraging [Inversion of Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) (IoC).

This is essentially an identical fork of the "Common Service Locator", orginally created by [Microsoft Patterns and Practices](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff921345.aspx) and hosted on [Codeplex](http://commonservicelocator.codeplex.com/).

The project targets [.NET Standard](https://github.com/dotnet/standard) 1.6.
